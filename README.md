# Sum Type

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/madebyatomicrobot/sumtype.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/madebyatomicrobot/sumtype)

Sum Type is an annotation processor that makes it simple to emulate sum types in Java via visitors.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union for an in depth explanation of sum types, read on, or check out the samples.

Motivation
==========

Java lacks support for sum types which can be useful.  We can get close with a composite value object and a visitor, but
that implementation is cumbersome to write and maintain.

Usage
=====

Assuming you had three types (`Loading`, `Error`, `Results`) you wanted to capture in a sum type, create an interface
 with those types and annoate it with `@SumType`

```
@SumType
public interface Query {
    Loading loading();
    Results results();
    Error error();
}
```

This will generate several classes for you to use, most important being `QuerySumType` and `QuerySumTypeVisitor`.

To build a new `QuerySumType`, the value holder, use one of the generated static factory methods:

```
QuerySumType query = QuerySumType.ofLoading(new Loading());
```

To ensure your code handles all of the cases a sum type can be in, pass in an implementation of a generated visitor interface.

```
query.accept(new QuerySumTypeVisitor() {
    @Override
    public void visitLoading(Loading loading) {
        System.out.println(loading.toString());
    }

    @Override
    public void visitResults(Results results) {
        System.out.println(results.toString());
    }

    @Override
    public void visitError(Error error) {
        System.out.println(error.toString());
    }
});
```

## Philosophy

Sum types are exceptionally useful when dealing with event based architectures and we would like to minimize the friction
required to make use of them in a language where they are not a first class citizen.

Including in your project
=========================

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }

  dependencies {
    // Or latest versions
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.2'
    classpath 'com.neenbedankt.gradle.plugins:android-apt:1.4'  // Or your preferred apt plugin if not using Android (see samples)
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'android-apt'  // Or your preferred apt plugin if not using Android (see samples)

dependencies {
  apt 'com.madebyatomicrobot:sumtype-compiler:{latest-version}'
  compile 'com.madebyatomicrobot:sumtype-annotations:{latest-version}'
}
```
